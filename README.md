# Student-Marks-Test-Assignment-Exam

Computer Input and Output functions
Program Name: Student Marks Program
Program Description: A simple student marks program that allows users to enter student marks.
Documentation:
Program Overview: This program is designed to provide a simple interface for users to perform logical operations.
Operation Selection: The program will allow users to select a logical operation to perform.
Program Logical Flow Components:
User input: The program will prompt user to enter their username and password.
User output: The program will have a message box stating whether student passed with a distinction or just passed or failed their course.
Calculation: The program will perform the selected arithmetic operation and display the result.
Error Handling: The program will have error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected errors and exceptions. If user uses a string or characters other than an integer from 0 to 100 in the program, a message box will pop up stating the user to enter numbers.
Data Structures and Access Method Components:
Program Design; The program design will consist of the following components:
Logical operations Form: This form will allow users to enter student’s test, assignment and examination marks.

Desk Checking: The program design will be desk checked to ensure that it meets the specifications and requirements. This will involve reviewing the program design to ensure that it is effective.

II.	Explain how the design can be implemented in the client’s computer environment.	       (8)
1. Install Python: Ensure Python is installed on the client's computer. You can download the latest version from the official Python website.

2. Install Tkinter: Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It's included with most Python installations, but if not, install it using pip: pip install tk.

3. Save the script: Save the provided Python script (e.g., (link unavailable)) on the client's computer.

4. Run the script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the script's location, and run it using Python: python (link unavailable).

5. Launch the GUI: The script will launch a GUI window with input fields for test, assignment, and examination marks. The client can enter their marks and click the "Submit" button to see the results.

6. Display results: The GUI will display messages indicating whether the client passed or failed each assessment, along with a distinction if applicable.

System Requirements:

Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
Python 3.x (latest version recommended)
Tkinter (included with Python or installed separately)

Deployment Options:

Run the script directly from the terminal/command prompt.
Create a desktop shortcut or executable file (using tools like PyInstaller) for easy access.
 Integrate the script into an existing Python application or framework.

By following these steps, the design can be successfully implemented in the client's computer environment, providing a user-friendly GUI application to assess marks.
